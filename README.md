- 👋 Hi, I’m @2queda
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Everything, Im a weldor, and lets throw in ,drafter and engioneer. I have about every out door hobby, I look for new inovations at work and at home,
So i like to build stuff. 


- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... right now im working on a 1 button Gps. Its on an Arduino nano, it prints to an oled screen time altitude location. The plan is when you push 
a button it saves your location and tells you how to get back to that location, untill you rest the start position, simple and dirt cheep, ok not simple to program. Later i will use it to make
a boat anchor, you know make your motor boat into a drone that hovers in one spot at the push of a button. not my first complicated project. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... stuff
